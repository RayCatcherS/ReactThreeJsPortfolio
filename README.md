This is the source code of my personal portfolio. This is the second revision, inspired by the first version developed with Flutter Web. The project is developed with React and set up using Vite. It also features some 3D experiments using Three.js. Other libraries used:
- Tailwind CSS as CSS framework
- React Router Dom as routing library
